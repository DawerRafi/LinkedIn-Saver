# LinkedIn-Saver
A short chrome extension that allows scrapping search results of people.

Introduction:
LinkedInSaver was designed to help people scrape out the results into a manageable csv format. The extension detects the page you are surfing by matching the URL and will show the 'Start Extraction' button when your active window has search results of people. 
On pressing the button, the extension would go page by page and combine all the results from each page and return a csv file for you to download making it easier for you to search and record the results.

DISCLAIMER:
LinkedIn may block you for excessive searching, therefore please filter your search results as much as you can before starting the extraction.

Installation:
To install this extension, just drag the 'LinkedInSaver v1.012.crx' file to the Extensions page of your Chrome.

Source Code:
The source code is available inside the folder 'LinkedInSaver v1.0'

NOTE: This scrapper is not for commercial use and the code is never garaunteed to work since the website structure may change over time.
The code is not being maintained but anyone is free to download and mould it to their needs given that due credit is given to Developer (me).
